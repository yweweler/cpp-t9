Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a Presidentgive me a break. A lot of people are concerned about which charity my 5M will be donated to. The onus is on Obama to first release his records. President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the 5M offer. President Obama, please take the 5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good. Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of Sandy. My honor.

Spoilerdennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of CelebApprentice... TRUMP International Reality will be Americas premiere real estate brokerage house http. w the most distinctive services. How does a dummy like billmaher get a television showamp his ratings stink. Youd think HBO could do a lot better. A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obamas lack of transparency. I do not blame them. There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the 5M to a charity of Obamas choice, once he releases all of his records. Looking at the figures and plans behind Disneys acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid AOL cont http. .Disneys acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides. Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue. In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi. Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater. How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week. Another scandal ignored by the liberal media. http. Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star. An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel http. A must read by friends and foes of President Obama. End date is tomorrow at noon. .oreillyfactor called me a master marketeer last nightI am not. I am a great builderI build great things amp people come. Part 2 of my jimmyfallon interview giving away some CelebApprentice spoilers amp discussing 2012 Miss Universe Pageant http. Part 1 of my jimmyfallon interview discussing my 5M offer to Obama, TRUMP Tower atrium, my tweets amp 57th st. crane http. Kevin Garnetts response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitornothing wrongin fact it was terrific. A champion. I was standing with SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett Celtics, said to a crowd Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump. Watch the clip from LateShow where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency http. I am not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my 5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up 5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he would not be doing it. What is he hiding. Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Photo. Lloyd BishopNBC http. The polls amp momentum are trending towards MittRomney. Do not let the hurricane change your thinking. Fans should not worry. We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm. Chinas stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses http. Their market gains the day we are hit by storm Maybe Obama should donate my 5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm. Scary. Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over 5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years. People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http. Why does Obama believe he should not comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition. Hiding something. digiphile RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get 5M for charityfor Red Cross or another great charity Glad to hear that taylorswift13 will be cohosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5. Taylor is terrific. Lets be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday. How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi. Without focus, it is just impossible to be successful at anything. Midas Touch I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my Ali G interview Another great cause Obama could send my 5M donation to is a charity for 911 First Responders. They are American heroes. My SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my 5M offer to Obama http. My extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm http. These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4 GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history. The election is trending towards MittRomney. Americans know we can not afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline. So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help I say thanks to you. http. The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place amp kept thousands of people warm amp safe during the stormthanks, staff. Remember this. Obama wants to raise taxes, MittRomney wants to lower taxesneed I say more. Do not let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states. People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium unlike others, I stayed open. http. I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast. Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obamas favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday. Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President do not fall for it. Hurricane is good luck for Obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars. I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm. The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse. All weights are on cranes wrong side very precarious below, move out. If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office. Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze. http. We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atriumthey are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food. So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Lets see what happens later. Many people walked out on Madonnas concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible. I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. The storm could be very good for him as he cont http. Obama lied 100 about Libya and the killingsemails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies. Dave Letterman LateShow said during my interview that Obama was probably born in the USthe word probably is a disaster for Obama. I am not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my 5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. What people do not know about BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early cont http. I guess BillMaher saw my ratings on the LateShow the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill, you are no Letterman. While BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct. .BetteMidler talks about my hair but I am not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body so I would not. Is this a double standard. Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers I agree. A lot changed when David Letterman said he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for Obama. johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John. BernardMcGuirk. Thats more than OReilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You are terrific. Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on OReilly...you are terrific. Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader. DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star. But, he just does not have what it takes...and he never will. I put DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement. I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.

My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohiomake sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can. Must win Ohio. Wheres the transparency. Despite Obamas denial sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright. Looking forward to being the special guest at tonights Dutchess County GOP dinnerto a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun. Pretty audacious for Obama to call MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we do not have room to write. By the way, where is Oprah. Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obamanow she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah. ...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why. Be careful of an Obama bomb to win election. Would be a horrible thing to do. The election is still close but trending toward MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obamas likeability is imploding. VOTE. Wow.

Another great charity that the 5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. the Wounded Warriors represented so well by TraceAdkins Lots of response that Obama should give the 5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi. Letterman LateShow was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the for charity. The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. The America We Deserve It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop 5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent. Doing David Letterman LateShow tonight at 11.30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lions den but I have been there many times before. Enjoy Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires... For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitts tax returns, you would think my offer to donate 5M to charity for his records is an easy go. Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in China http. I do not think this was a gaffe. China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports http. We need MittRomney to rein them in. I hope Derek Jeters recovery is going well.

In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public... ... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have 5 million go to a charity. Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. Why can not he release his records. Especially when 5M is going to charity. I am happy to donate 5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses. All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people I just learned that politico has no credibilitytotal phonies that do not report the truth. A puppet of Obama. Glad to hear seanhannity supports my offer to Obama. As Sean says it is an easy 5 million to charity. What does Obama have to lose. Third rate politico took every negative tweet or response they could find amp put it outwhen in fact the response is incredibly positive. My offer to Obama is about transparency.

I only wish Mitt was more aggressive. Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert amp Kristen.I do not have time except to say Robert, drop her, she cheated on you amp will again. Last night was the first time Obama said we instead of I in respect to Bin Ladens killing. Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden now he wants all of the credit. My announcement is tomorrow. Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject. China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own. Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Ladens killing, not the President. .MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night.

I always said that lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening. 70 of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http. At least someone has done well under Obama. The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obamas failed foreign policy and I mean much more. Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down. I will be doing SquawkCNBC at 7.30. Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. debate .MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward. Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly. Well this is it, the final debate lets see how it goes. I will be tweeting live. Former Obama White House economic adviser AustanGoolsbee gave his old boss a C on the economy http. Pretty generous. Why do not we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden. They do not seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K. I look forward to MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs. Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obamajust wait and see. Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert. Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden. This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. Obama to MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal. Obama planted that nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonights debate. He wants Libya and China off the table. The brass in TRUMP Towers atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success. .Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick very thrilling. I wish tonights debate would cover more than foreign policy. Do not let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get electedbe careful Republicans. .Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello.

My twitter followers will soon be over 2 millionamp all the biggies. It is like having your own newspaper. My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth. Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like hell have to start a war or major conflict to win. Do not put it past him. Obama did much better than he did last timebut still lost decisively. Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama aka Barry Soetoro looked like a president last night. I do not. Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period. I still love Derek, he is a winner. Remember, I said Derek do not sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot. At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didnt he do it. He lost me a long time ago. Verlander pitched great, but Yankees look truly defeated. Stupid George Will gave MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he is just another dummy. George Will said best debate he ever saw. If you ever heard George Will speakboring anything is exciting. Debate showed these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. Obama better than last time, but again, MittRomney wins. Good night. debate You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy. Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done. .MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer. Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton he is no Bill Clinton. Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He is been Prez 4 years. Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. MittRomney is looking strong and sharp. Obama just said MittRomney was a very successful investor big mistake for Obama to admit he has less and less credibility. Obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasnt he done it. It is all talk. .MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential. Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices. Good response on jobs by MittRomney. Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs. Why hasnt Obama created jobs. Getting ready to watch the debate as they say lets get ready to rumble. I was just told by one of the top PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice complimentI agree. We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just do not believe we would. drumlinemormon It is selling great at Macysthanks. For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election. Great win last night by Peyton Manning amp DenverBroncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive. If the yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6amp 7 so they will win. Get ready for tonight. MissUSA Oliviawe love you. You are doing a great job. .MittRomneyif Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records amp transcriptshe will quiet down quickly. Good luck MittRomney tonighthave no doubt you will be great. Congratulations to JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud. DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice. I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called revolution to attack our embassy in Benghazi. .washtimes BrettMDecker. Five Questions w realDonaldTrumpLack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America http. Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast amp Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President. .reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Partyhope he gets the credit he deserves. .antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep. .Historys wonderful The Men Who Built America with me on tonight at 9 bad timing, I will be live tweeting the debate Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonights audience will be humongouspeople want to see if he is for real. The Coca Cola company is not happy with methats okay, I will still keep drinking that garbage. It is amazingmy weekly scheduled interviews on foxnews and CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by weekthanks folks. Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent. Diet Coke tweet had a monster responsedammit, I wish the stuff worked. .antbaxter Thanks for helping promote amp make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successfulyou stupid fool. .antbaxter Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent. I can confirm the reportsBillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this AllStar season of CelebApprentice. .rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for Israel if Obama is reelected. Verlander is great but very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers. I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. Well all be watching MittRomney. Lots of pressure on Obama tonighteven more than ARod. If he does not perform well it could be over. I hope ARod has a great night for the Yankeeshe owes it to themespecially with Derek hurt. jbluvx2 Happy Birthday. Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from MittRomneyDo not waste your vote. Obama must go. Donald Trumps back with 14 Apprentice AllStars http. via AP Based on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate. The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. MittRomney Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by. Donald J. Trump If MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished. Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrows debate http. Mitt should bring up college applications amp records Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation http. via ABC Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us. ARod should donate his contract to charity. He does not make the yankees any money and he does not perform. He is a 30Myr rip off. Looking forward to speaking at tonights gala for MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitts doing well. Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history. Is not it time that Obama release his college records and applications. Boy would that create a mess. He is not who you think. Lots of response to my comment on Diet Cokelets face it, it does not work just makes you hungry. ARod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue even though he was on the juice. Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower I told him not to sell karma. I love LibertyUniversitysuch great people. ARod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great. Obama will be trying very hard at next debate he does not want to lose the Boeing. Who says Obama will do better in the next debate has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks. .MittRomneys poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke. No, I was not at the Yankees game yesterday can not go today either. When I go, they win. Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever Boring would not matter if they winWinning solves all problems cont http. Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. ARod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave. Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night. .Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try ARod at short get him some confidence. A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter he is a great champion. So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg they deserved to lose. Roadway steel on beautiful VerrazanoNarrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late. Tonight, despite everything, put ARod in the lineup. Everyones wondering what is wrong with ARod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore the real reason. They found Jessica in Colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer. Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series. I will bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he does not use ourthis countrys best people to win. Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve they would have won. When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say what were we doing. I told you, whenever I go to a Yankees game the Yankees win. Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. Warren G. Bennis When an employee leaves me and begs to come backI never let them. Loyalty is very important. I look forward to Tuesday nights presidential debateI wonder if Obama will use my name again. Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate. What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. PaulRyanVP Obamas economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200 since he was elected. With our amazing All Star cast, JoanRivers, johnrich, ArsenioOFFICIAL amp piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors. Great to hear that our loyal CelebApprentice fans are happy with todays announcement of the new cast. This will be something special. .dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act. I am going to the Yankees game tonight to root them onthey always win when I am there. My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the worlda great honor for me. Credibility is important to me hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. VPDebate Doing the todayshow with MLauer was great I really like Matt. First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight 103 on compassionate grounds. Do you believe. There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt dennisrodman ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet. ObamaCare is a complete disaster.

Going over to TodayShow now to introduce ApprenticeNBC cast etc. watch. Pretty even debate no knockouts. However Ryans closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think. VPDebate Bidens statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. VPDebate Excellent story on MittRomney very good moment for Ryan. VPDebate Bidens sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. VPDebate Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. VPDebate Both candidates are looking sharp now it is up to the mouth and the mind. VPDebate Get ready this should be informative and fun. VPDebate Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment. .LindaMcMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC.

Why the hell did we help the Libyan rebels in the first place. That is the real scandal. Outright disgustingthe Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smiths mother http. I suspect JoeBiden could do well tonight. Do not be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater. If rihanna is dating chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beaterjust watch. Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last nights yankees game and did so well. 30M a year and ARod is now relegated to the bench. yankees would have lost if Girardi hadnt benched him in the 9th see my prediction I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero. .Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7.30am ET on the todayshow with MLauer Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked ARodto put it mildly The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter. Asking why my dislike of ARoddishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal Great move to take ARod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation drugs.

I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night. You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird. MittRomney Consumer spending fell in September http. Another indicator the 7.8 unemployment number is cooked. ARod must be dropped in the Yankees lineup tonight if they want to win. He simply can not perform without drugs. Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatzs wedding http. Do people think this is fair.

Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations. Media. I just had to fire someone, he didnt have a cluehe reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night. 27 days until Americas greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again. It does not matter who you vote forit matters who is counting the votes. Be careful of voter fraud. Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Lets see how he reacts under pressure. Remember, Obama limped across the finish linehe should have lost to Hillary. Be careful. I do not think Obama will do well in the second debatehe is psyched out just like ARod. I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. Mitt By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate Thursday night. It will be very interesting, I promise. .DavidLetterman LateShow fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you Davidwe are again friends. The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks Now that Obamas poll numbers are in tailspin watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate. Mitts subsequent rise in the polls postdebate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner. In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate.

Can you believe that President Karzai of Afghanistan is holding out for more, more, more and refuses to sign deal. Tell him to go to hell. Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOURE FIRED, I do not like firing people. But ZERO on ObamaCare messno way. Why does not President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that ObamaCare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan. US froze 8B in Iranian assets during 79 Hostage Crisis. Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed. Do not do it. Happy Thanksgiving to alleven the haters and losers. Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor goand I mean right now.

President Obama is finally getting hammered, even by his most loyal supporters and the pressI guess they can only take so much. New poll, WOW53 say President Obama is not honest amp trustworthy. What took them so long. Go back and look at his house purchase in Chicago Do not worry, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE GREAT AGAIN. Just got home, watching the news, and every story is bad about the U.S. Someday we will return to being great again, but we need leadership. The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. The Art of The Deal. Why didnt Obama, as part of the negotiation, free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini. http. Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that. Who would you rather have negotiating with IranPresident Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford. My money is on Ford. Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You are in charge. Everything starts with you. Do not underestimate yourself or your possibilitieskeep your focus intact, and focus on the positives. After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars, J.P.Morgans lawyer is critical of the amount of the finewhy did they settle thenDUMB. Best book ever on dealmaking or so they say TRUMP. THE ART OF THE DEAL. Go get it, and others, Washington you really can do better. I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but is not it about time we start, right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one Tom Brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner. Fantastic comeback winthis is what our country needs. Tom Brady has done a great job tonightamazing New England comeback. Good game not over yet. We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. WHY. How much longer are we expected to put up with the worlds most incompetent leader ObamaCare, Iran, Syria, bads deals. JUST NEVER ENDS I will be on Fox amp Friends tomorrow morning at 7. Will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence, of which our leaders have plenty. otcgiant. realDonaldTrump with even a half decent running mate I do not see how you could lose against the Democrats ineptness. Trumo2016 I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election. He is a TOTAL DISASTER FOR ISRAELAND ALWAYS WILL BE How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran. Read THE ART OF THE DEAL. What a rotten deal we made with Iran. We get nothing except laughter at our stupidity. They get everything, including delay and big cash. They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just was not working. The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare. mikehaas33. realDonaldTrump mar a lago a spectacular property.

Such a nice article in the New York Times about a wonderful developer, Arthur Zeckendorf http. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule. Harry Reid amp Obama killed it yesterday. Rule was in effect for over 200 years. Since the Democrats decided to kill the filibuster, they now own it.Republicans should keep the new rule when theyre in the majority. Hypocrite.

Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates, therefore, to remain low.

All I can say is that if I were President, Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. by their fastest jet and with an apology. Snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and U.S.prestige. China is laughing at us as he continues illegal action Snowden is sitting in China and taunting the U.S. He is mocking us as a Country. Great time to place a tax on China trade if not turned over peaceloveandmeg. but when you are in a beauty contest ran by realDonaldTrump , all the contestants are republican. Bad grammar run. marzanoj. realDonaldTrump people think of u as a real estate king. Rightly so, however, u r the marketing king as well. Thank you. Like it or not, haters and losers, everybody is talking about Miss U.S.A. and Miss Utah. By the way she is a fine young womanunfair to her. Frankly, for a writer, I dont think DannyZukers stuff is good. In fact, its terrible. I own DannyZuker, but he has his friends amp haters amp losers tweeting that he beat me. He cant beat me at anything. A country that does not control or respect its own borders is a country destined for failure. Secure our borders. Trending story on Miss Utah is very unfair.

The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his. Gen. George S.

What did you think of the boardroom. CelebApprentice George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time. CelebApprentice George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. Hes a tough negotiator. CelebApprentice Looking forward to THEGaryBuseys book of Buseyisms. Romance or Adventure what do you prefer. CelebApprentice For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. CelebApprentice George has a real twinkle about him says TheRealMarilu. Really. The shark should be scared. CelebApprentice This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. CelebApprentice This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of lisarinna and pennjillette. CelebApprentice George Ross could be rightTHEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. CelebApprentice .TraceAdkins isnt excited about their ideas. Are you. CelebApprentice .THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand. Their team is short on help already CelebApprentice How stressed are lisarinna and pennjillette already. CelebApprentice I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonights show is great and Brett Michaels is back. Everybody loves bretmichaels. Hes a great champion and this is where he should be. He agrees. .bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors. Good to see them. CelebApprentice .TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a 40,000 check for Sandy Relief. You can tell hes very pleased about thatamp rightly so. Seems like the teams are surprised when THEGaryBusey comes back. CelebApprentice What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well. I suspect he may talk. Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, speak to my lawyers. Do not forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it. I do not know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning. Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape. If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand. NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards. Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse. BullshitPop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money split between brothers and sisters and I built it into over 9 bill. bracybuilders. realDonaldTrump just a playboy CoachClintSwan Tell me, what were they doing in the Park, playing checkers. Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprenticesome really crazy things happen. Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9. It will be a full two hour show. ajbarker50. realDonaldTrump do you try to make everything about you. YES. NextLevelStoner Great. You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trumpthey have no limitsbut they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer. I know some of you may think lm tough and harsh but actually I am a very compassionate person with a very high IQ with strong common sense Didnt the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away. We are not dealing with an innocent baby hereDEATH When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killingsmaimings I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as the suspect. The shirts and ties at Macys are so goodbeautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piecel kicked his ass I just won a big Court decision N.Y. Post against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties. Oh no, they are worried that they didnt read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish. t JoeTran19. realDonaldTrump how do u feel about Marco Rubio.

It was a onesided piece of garbagea total disgrace. .CNN should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day amp get back to reporting. David Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of TIME Magazine nobody could bring it back like David. http. MarlboroStan Youve got it mixed up. Chechnya is not the Czech Republic.

One positive from last week for Lance was that everyone was focused on Manti Teo. Why did Lance do that interview. Watch this great behind the scenes video of IvankaTrumps Spring 2013 photo shoot http. Republicans are always worried about their general approval.

Part of Obamas newfound confidence is that the Republicans arent using their power of ideas properly or effectively. Obamas speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know itwow, he really feels emboldened. If the Republicans need a chief negotiator I am always availableor can recommend some really good ones. Republicans, dont extend the debt ceilingmake the great deal now. The Presidents speech was very combative toward Republicansthey have obviously not earned his respect. Socialists think profits are a vice I consider losses the real vice.

Dumbass BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice. Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before. .ESPNs apologyBrent Musburger was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct. IMO Manti Teo was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy. Can it just be new age that Manti Teo fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax. Not believable that Manti Teo was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died. He is either very stupid.... ...or mentally troubled or a con. Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of Deadspin for exposing the Manti Teo fiasco. The first ever AllStar Celebrity ApprenticeNBC premieres Sunday March 3rd. http. Look, I have always liked Lance Armstrong I just hated what he did to himself, including recently. His life will now be hell. Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah. Ill bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again. Lance Armstrong was given very,very bad advice. Journal News readership is already down 50 percent over the years.

Time To Get Tough Still waiting for a response from billmaher. Does he even have 5 million. Sadly, Im probably helping billmahers lowly rated showbut charity will benefit by 5 million so its worth it. .nbc did a great job last night with the GoldenGlobes. Back by popular demand, latoyajackson returns to the 13th season of All Star CelebApprentice. She is fierce in the Board Room. Just as I predicted, today Obama called for even more tax increases. The Republicans played right into his hands and blew their cards. Remember, as a senator, Obama did not vote for increasing the debt ceiling http. I guess things change when President.. Can you imagine if Obama had to give todays press conference before the election. He would have lost. GOP really blew it. According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. PrimetimeEmmys Lance Armstrong is now going to admit guiltcan that be possible after many years of denying. Just go away Lance. Is billmaher the dumbest man on television.I think so. By the way, folks, billmaher is not a smart guy just look at his pasthe just pretends he is. Dopey billmaher is in for a lot of troubleI hope he has 5 million for charity. I am a handwriting analyst. Jack Lews handwriting shows, while strange, that he is very secretivenot necessarily a bad thing. The Republicans have been played into a trap by the Presidentthey forgot the 14th amendment..... ...and will be very embarrassed unless they get smart fast.

TrumpCondosLV bring unparalleled style, elegance and world class amenities to Las Vegas http. Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9.00 oclock in the evening. What were they thinking. Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you would not see another black president for generations. As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson. Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now. Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a leader, this would not be the case TheRealZach49. This is why we need realDonaldTrump in office. BarackObama does not know how to keep order AbdulAkbarzai1. TheRealZach49. realDonaldTrump can not wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed DMellette. realDonaldTrump for president 2k16 Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9.00 in the evening a prime time for riots. Not smart. Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators. ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented. There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.

I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple, but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent. Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.Obamas fault If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people amp resign.

I have realized that success requires 100 effort and 100 focus. Nothing less. Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago. I had the big boxing, introduced UFC ask Dana,the best shows Can you believe that the U.S. will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola.They will come home infected. We have enough problems It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years airport, convention center, etc. I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price, to save Plaza amp Taj. They were run badly by funds. If you cant focus with unyielding resolve, then you will never be successful. Believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals.

If youve looked over the years,Ive been right on virtually every issue from Iraq not going in but if so taking the oil to jobs to China By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target 1. How totally stupid is this guy. wesbart53. Watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. Carteresque, weak. His delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero True. This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components not rolling over and dealing from weakness. Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC. President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands. He is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead it is tough work for him He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else.

Doesnt look presidential and at some point he will take a fall. I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soonlong overdue. Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off March.Madness, and LEAD. Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare. The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper amp survive I believe Putin will continue to rebuild the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.. Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD Great advice from my mother. Trust in God and be true to yourself. Mary MacLeod Trump Great advice from my father. Know everything you can about what you are doing. Fred C. Trump Continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential. Winston Churchill President Obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and FOCUS no more March Madness, and you can beat Putin at his own game. IT CAN BE DONE. While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness basketball. I do not hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history. We are spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and thats OKbut how much are Russia amp China spending. President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected, but not able to fool Vladimir Putin. Too bad for us. Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.

Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I am lowering taxes, while he will double amp triple them, a disaster. Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now. Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad. I WILL FIX. The middleclass has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years.

Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid. RNC .BernieSanderswho blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her email crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie. The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT. Be smart and win for a change. R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW. It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD. CAC8438.

Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It is about time. Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill. Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past JebBush in the new CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3, I am at 39. Stop throwing your money down the drain. In the ridiculous JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but does not allow my answer, which destroys him SO SAD.

Classic .JebBushs opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terriblefumbled around, incoherent. Why does not JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate. Will JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate. .JebBush just took millions of s in special interest money to look like a tough guy.

Watch Kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun. I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I dont want to waste my money. John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls.

Why wouldnt the WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly. When and how are the dummies at the WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want smart trade deals. The WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often.

China not part but will get their way in later. Todays WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer. Pres. We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before. I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far. Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad. I have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, nbc and CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next, at 29. Fiorina has 11. There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California.

Why would anybody listen to MittRomney. He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain. Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, GregAbbottTX, for taking a tough amp bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry. I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept. ....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. It is a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans..... I will make this right for our great Vets. All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. ....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives. The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes. In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President.

Hopefully there would not be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm, be cooldo not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for. The best social program, by far, is a JOB. Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries incompetent leader. President Obama, you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership, it can be done. Do it. Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking, each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore. Vanderpunked. Can we drop realDonaldTrump off in the middle of Baltimore so he can show Obama how it is done. I would fix it fast. The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy another real genius. Now that the ineffective Baltimore Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it again. Our great African American President hasnt exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore. Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD. Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly. Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough, and fast. Thugs must be stopped. TrumpAdvice https.

We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. So much time and money will be spent same result. Sad this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy. She then said, We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald of position. Then, separately she stated, He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind and fair elections. Weve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a Hillarys debate answer on delay. That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. Weve had free Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore.

Look forward to it. Jeff Sessions, a Fitting Selection for Attorney General https. Presidentelect Donald J. Trumps CIA Director Garners Praise https. https. Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. The failing nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that but why announce. Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone. I cancelled todays meeting with the failing nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice Many people would like to see NigelFarage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job. Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal. .transition2017 update and policy plans for the first 100 days. https. I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news. General James Mad Dog Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true Generals General. I watched parts of nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally onesided, biased show nothing funny at all. Equal time for us. Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize. Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen. The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad. I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country. Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky no Mexico My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. MAGA Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, The failing nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. I am not trying to get top level security clearance for my children. This was a typically false news story. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are. The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different. If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win. I will be interviewed on 60Minutes tonight after the NFL game 7.00 P.M. Enjoy. The nytimes states today that DJT believes more countries should acquire nuclear weapons. How dishonest are they. I never said this. Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible. Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice. Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice. The nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change doubt it. Wow, the nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the Trump phenomena This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win. Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. ThankAVet https. Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government. Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.

I always do trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc but media misrepresents. I have always been the same personremain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so. It is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false. I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it. Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose. My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20 The failing nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I amnever said The failing nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary. zuluout.

This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart. Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same Nice. Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, onesided and biased the media is against us. The failing nytimes is a joke. CNN is laughable. RealJamesWoods. Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldnt stand a chance. VoterFraud and MSM her only hope. The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H. I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond. Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me. Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it.

Crookeds stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 with Bill, VP CrookedHillary Obamas third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth seen below. https. Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA. I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better. Why does not the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches Republicans won ratings CrookedHillary https. Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster.

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. CNN and the little watched MorningJoe SAD. No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. Hillarys wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. Hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street. Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. Hillarys refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550 increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

The Republican Convention was great Funny, if you listen to FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it. Waste of time. Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated. Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future. I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. I was at FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air. Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.

MAGA The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE. Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn. Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and emails yet can you believe. Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance. Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC they just got caught, thats all. They laughed at Bernie. If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released emails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Thank you. MakeAmericaGreatAgain https. Hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened. How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb emails, using even religion, against Bernie. The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should never have been written stupid, because Putin likes me Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix Americas problems. ISIS amp all others laughing. The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you. The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she is out. The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing. Emails say the rigged system is alive amp well. Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I do not believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook. Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out If the Republican Convention had blown up with emails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. Bernie, media would go wild The CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Do not watch CNN. I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left. Today proves what I have always known, that Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz DWStweets. Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can not go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new emails and DNC disrespect. SAD. There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution. He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end. An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite. Wow, President Obamas brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else. Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement. TOTAL DISRESPECT The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H. MakeAmericaGreatAgain TrumpPence16 https. NancyNielsenn. realDonaldTrump Dinesh DSousa Hillarys America. see it OliMauritania. realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals https. HillaryKaine2016 Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart. The Wikileaks email release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud. Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They do not look presidential to me. I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs. Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer. Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back. Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Leaked emails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. Online from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but was not chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her. Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing. The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight. TheresaCali. realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS. MakeAmericaSafeAgain I highly recommend the just out book THE FIELD OF FIGHT by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didnt get indicted while Bob M did. Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich. One of the best produced, including the incredible stage amp set, in the history of conventions. Great unity. Big T.V. ratings. KarlRove Thank you Cleveland.

Good news is Melanias speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press. In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs. Bill Hemmer of FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

Pick her H I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud. It does not matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement.

I am spending a lot myself and also helping others. Voters understand that Crooked Hillarys negative ads are not true just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Not fit. Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT. I do not think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with murder. Come November 8, she is out. Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party.

She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa. Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people. Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally onesided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid.

In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed. I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught. The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting go away, no pictures. Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac. THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED. On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil. Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged amp corrupt. Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know. Just watched meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good newsthe people get it. It was just announcedby sourcesthat no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged.

If you want to know about Hillary Clintons honesty amp judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens. Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. I am the king of debt.That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S. ObamaClinton inherited 10T in debt and turned it into nearly 20T. They have bankrupted https. Hillary Clintons open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans and make everyone less safe. How can Hillary run the economy when she can not even send emails without putting entire nation at risk. Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40 as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs. Hillary says this election is about judgment. She is right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton. Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our presidentreally bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess.

My hit was on China The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. You can tell them to go BLANK themselves was about China, NOT WOMEN.

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you. In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history. The writer of the now proven false story in the nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond. Over 50 women were interviewed by the nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements. No wonder the nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false, malicious amp libelous story they did on me. The failing nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing nytimes story yesterday joined foxandfriends. https. Thank you, Anthony Scaramucci WSJ The Entrepreneurs Case for Trump https. With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud.

Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing nytimes story yesterday, was on foxandfriends saying Times lied The nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie. That was an amazing interview on foxandfriends I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the nytimes is. Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent. Run Bernie, run. Great new poll thank you. MakeAmericaGreatAgain Trump2016 https.

Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clintons flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud. I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both. Response to LindseyGrahamSC. https.

CruzFraud https. I will be interviewed on greta at 7.00 P.M. Enjoy. FoxNews Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice a total lie. The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of F and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus or vote for Cruz. Ted Cruz didnt win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad. Great job on donlemon tonight kayleighmcenany cherijacobus begged us for a job.

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wifes employer, and his lender, is located there. Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer. Ted Cruz said he didnt know that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million loan papers.Not believable Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.
